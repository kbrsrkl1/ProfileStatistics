# ProfileStatistics

This project involves creating an interactive profile statistics display showcasing work experience, websites made, and apps made. The design centers around three icons from the Font Awesome library: a briefcase for work experience, a cloud for websites made, and an apple for apps made. Each icon is accompanied by a number that increments from zero to the final value, achieved using the JavaScript set time method to create a function that proportionally increments the number. This effect triggers every time the page loads. The design is styled with CSS to create a modern and sleek look. The end result is an engaging and visually appealing way to showcase professional accomplishments on a profile.
